# Schoggifabrik

A puzzle project: Write haskell code that fulfills the requirements to clear each level.

The problems should be straight forward for someone who already knows their way around haskell.

## Requirements

  * Set the environment variable `SCHOGGIFABRIK:SHELL` or `SCHOGGIFABRIK__SHELL` to the path of the target shell

## Tested on

* Windows 10
